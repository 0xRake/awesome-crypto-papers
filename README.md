# awesome-crypto-papers
A curated list of cryptography papers, articles, tutorials and howtos.

### Notes 

The goal of this list is to provide reading material for different levels of cryptographic knowledge. I started it because my day job onboarding engineers includes educating them in cryptographic matters, and that involves finding the same materials repeatedly. Hopefully, it will be useful for someone else, too.

## The list

### Introducing people to data security and cryptography

#### Simple: cryptography for non-engineers

* [Nuts and Bolts of Encryption: A Primer for Policymakers](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/encryption_primer.pdf)

### Introduction to specific topics

#### Elliptic-curve crypto

* [Elliptic Curve cryptography: A gentle introduction](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/17/elliptic-curve-cryptography-a-gentle-introduction/)
* [Elliptic Curve Cryptography: finite fields and discrete logarithms](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/23/elliptic-curve-cryptography-finite-fields-and-discrete-logarithms/)
* [Elliptic Curve Cryptography: ECDH and ECDSA](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/30/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecdh-and-ecdsa/)
* [Elliptic Curve Cryptography: breaking security and a comparison with RSA](http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/06/08/elliptic-curve-cryptography-breaking-security-and-a-comparison-with-rsa/)
* [Let's construct an elliptic curve: Introducing Crackpot2065](http://blog.bjrn.se/2015/07/lets-construct-elliptic-curve.html)

### Books

That seems somewhat out of scope, isn't it? But these are books only fully available online for free. Read them as a sequence of papers if you will.

* [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/) by Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup. A well-balanced introductory course into cryptography, a bit of cryptoanalysis and cryptography-related security.
* [CrypTool book](https://www.cryptool.org/en/ctp-documentation/ctbook), predominantly mathematically oriented information on learning, using and experimenting cryptographic procedures.
* [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/) by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone. Good classical introduction into cryptography and ciphers.
* [The joy of Cryptography](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/) by Mike Rosulek. A lot of basic stuff covered really well. No ECC.

### Lectures and educational courses

* [Understanding cryptography: A textbook for Students and Practitioners](http://www.crypto-textbook.com/) Textbook, great lectures and problems to solve.
* [Crypto101](https://www.crypto101.io/) Crypto 101 is an introductory course on cryptography, freely available for programmers of all ages and skill levels.
