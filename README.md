### Notes 

The goal of this list is to provide reading material for different levels of cryptographic knowledge. I started it because my day job onboarding engineers includes educating them in cryptographic matters, and that involves finding the same materials repeatedly. Hopefully, it will be useful for someone else, too.

## The list

### Introducing people to data security and cryptography

#### Cryptography

* [Nuts and Bolts of Encryption: A Primer for Policymakers](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~felten/encryption_primer.pdf)


### Books

* [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/) by Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup. A well-balanced introductory course into cryptography, a bit of cryptoanalysis and cryptography-related security.
* [CrypTool book](https://www.cryptool.org/en/ctp-documentation/ctbook), predominantly mathematically oriented information on learning, using and experimenting cryptographic procedures.
* [Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/) by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone. Good classical introduction into cryptography and ciphers.
