# Awesome crypto papers

A curated list of cryptography papers, articles, tutorials and howtos.

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

### Notes 

The goal of this list is to provide educational reading material for different levels of cryptographic knowledge. I started it because my day job onboarding engineers at [Cossack Labs](https://www.cossacklabs.com) includes educating them in cryptographic matters and giving advise what to read on specific topics, and that involves finding the same materials repeatedly. Hopefully, it will be useful for someone else as well.

This list intends to capture most of the classic papers necessary to get into certain topics in it's historic context, not bleeding edge (because it moves as you read this). Due to nature of my work, many subjects or important papers are not covered here, it is not intentional and everyone is welcome to contribute/correct anything.
